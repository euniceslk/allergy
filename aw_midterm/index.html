				<h2>What is Food Allergy?</h2>

				<p>True Food Allergy - The job of the body’s immune system is to identify and destroy germs (such as bacteria or viruses) that make you sick. A food allergy results when the immune system mistakenly targets a harmless food protein – an allergen – as a threat and attacks it.</p>

				<p>Depending on an individual’s level of sensitivity, allergies can be triggered even by smelling or touching the off ending food. Almost all true allergies are caused by the “big 8” foods.</p>

				<p>Food Intolerate &ndash; It is a metabolic food disorder,you can’t metabolize certain components in food, often because the body lacks a particular enzyme to digest that food. e.g. lactose intolerance.   Symptoms of a food intolerance are usually gastrointestinal. The immune system isn’t involved, and exposure to the off ending food isn’t directly life-threatening.</p>

				<p><strong>Food</strong> Sensitivity  &ndash; Like allergies, food sensitivities involve an adverse reaction to certain foods; unlike true allergies, however, the immune system isn’t involved. Sensitivities are much more common than allergies, and often include symptoms such as nausea, bloating, headaches, joint pain, or rashes. Food sensitivities include food idiosyncrasy, an adverse reaction to food that occurs through unknown mechanisms. Symptoms may resemble those of an allergy, ranging from mild to severe.</p>

				<img class="centered-display" src="images/symptom_icon.png" >

				<p>Symptoms of food allergies tend to be immediate, in reactions ranging in severity from mild to life&ndash;threatening. The most severe&mdash;but rare&mdash; reaction is anaphylaxis, which causes hives, breathing difficulties, and swelling of the throat. It’s uncommon, and occurs in fewer than 70 people per 100,000</p>

				<h2>Growing Trend in Developed Countries</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>It is estimated that up to <strong>15 million Americans</strong> have food allergies.</li>

					<li>According to a study released in 2013 by the Centers for Disease Control and 	Prevention, food allergies among children <strong>increased approximately 50&#37; between 1997 and 2011</strong> in U.S.</li>

					<li>Researchers are trying to discover why food allergies are on the rise in developed countries worldwide, and to learn more about the impact of the disease in developing nations. More than 17 million Europeans have a food allergy, and hospital admissions for severe reactions in children have risen seven&ndash;fold over the past decade, according to the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology &#40;EAACI&#41;.</li>

					<li>It is possible to outgrow of milk, egg and soy allergies during teenage, but not for peanuts, fish, shellfish and tree nuts.</li>

				</ul>

				<h2>Prevention is the key</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>Read Food Labels</li>
					<li>Keep Clean</li>
					<li>Be Prepared for Unintentional Exposure</li>
					<li>Wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace</li>
					<li>Carry an auto-injector device containing epinephrine &#40;adrenaline&#41;</li>
					<li>Seek medical help immediately</li>
